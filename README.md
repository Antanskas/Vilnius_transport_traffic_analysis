  * **1st conclusion**  
  From the plots above we can see that average transport volume in the whole Vilnius city tends to decrease in winter and summer and increase in spring and autumn. Most accupied month - May, least - January. Alse it is clearly noticable that transport volume during working daygs is nearly twice as big as in weekends <br>

  *  **2nd conclusion**  
As can be expected during peak hours (17PM - 18PM) transport volume is biggest. Then decresing trend is noticed till 4AM. After that volume starts increasing. <br>

   *  **3rd conclusion**
As we can see during weekends (5 and 6) transport volume is much lower compared to other days(working days). Most occupied days seems are monday and friday. <br>

*    **5th conclusion**  
From above interactive map we can see that biggest traffic volume tends to appear in Antakalnis street, around city center. One of the biggest circle locates in Ozas street from Valakampis bridge. It tells that one of the biggest transport transparency appears there, Darius ir Gireno street as well.
